# pomodoroTimerJs
a very simple html+css+javascript for a pomodoro timer for studying

BUGS: 
  -when the study session ends, a message is prompted, but after that the button start/pause stay into "pause" mode, so in order for the relax session to start, the user has to click "pause" making it change into "start" again, and then press "start" and the relax session starts.

IMPROVEMENTS:
  -let user change relax time
  -let user change number of sessions
  -add background
  -add optional chill music
  -put actual checkboxes, not 'O' and 'X'
